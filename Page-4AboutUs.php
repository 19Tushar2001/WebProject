                <p>
                    “The Company was founded in 2002 to revolutionize space technology, with the ultimate goal of enabling people to live on other planets.”
                    SpaceZ is our commercial branch that works and co-ordinate with the customers.

                <h3>Core Values.</h3>
                <p>
                    Our core values comprise “innovative, being a risk-taker, inclusivity, and diversity.” These are the common values that anyone can pick out from the practices of our company. They are central in the overall performance of the company and its constant success streak.

                <h3>Business Philosphy.</h3>
                <p>
                    The business model of SpaceZ is simple. SpaceZ creates and captures value by charging customers to launch things into outer space. They are able to capture more customers by driving down launch costs. There is a lot of opportunity in space but it is costly to put something out there and only the largest telecommunications companies and government agencies can pay to launch satellites, experiments, or people into space. In 2010 NASA was paying roughly $380 million per launch. Currently, when you watch a rocket launch something into space, that rocket is disposed of and can’t be used again. We often relates it to the idea of having to throw away a 747 airplane after every trip. If this was the case, a one way ticket from Boston to Shanghai on a 747 would cost $500,000. No one would pay, and no one would travel via airplanes. SpaceZ advertises a roughly $60 million launch price, but believes it can cut that price by an order of magnitude if it can develop reusable rockets. How were we able to cut launch costs and why do we think we can cut the price even more? Our operating model enables these cost cuts and is founded on the ideas of first principles.
